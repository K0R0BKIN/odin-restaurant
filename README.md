# Restaurant Page

A small project to practice JavaScript modules, DOM manipulation, and basic Webpack setup.

You can find the project brief [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-restaurant-page).

## Implementation Notes

- **HTML Partials > DOM manipulation:** Rather than building each page section entirely with JavaScript DOM methods, I use predefined HTML partials and dynamically insert them as needed. I find this method simpler, more readable, and still consistent with the learning goals of the project.
- **ES Modules > index.js:** I made liberal use of ES6 modules to separate utility functions and components into their own files, keeping the codebase clean and maintainable.
